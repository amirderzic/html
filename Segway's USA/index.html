			Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Walla Wall, WA</li>
				<li>Magic City, ID</li>
				<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
				<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
				<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
				<li>Why, AZ</li>
			</ol>

			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			"Passing cars,<br>
			 When you can't see,<br>
			 May get you A glimpse,<br>
			 Of eternity."<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			I definitely won't be passing any cars!

		<p>
			My first day of the trip! I can't belive I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>cell phone</li>
			<li>iPod</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>protein bar.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said: <q>A journey of a thousand miles begns with one step Segway.</q>
